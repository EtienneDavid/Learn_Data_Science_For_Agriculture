# Learn_Data_Science_For_Agriculture

You want to use the power of Data Science for Agriculture ? I've gathered ressources to improve in both domains in order to be able to tackle the biggest issues


## I- The biggest challenges to adress 

A healther, more, sustaniable world achieved through imagination, innovation and collaboration 

### Grand challenges: 
- Increase production of more nutritional food 
- Presere naturalressources like water and topsoil 
- Develop sustainable sources of bioenergy 

### Innovative Technology to accelerate discovery 
- Genomics / Phenomics 
- Crisp genome editing 
- Robotics / Imaging 
- Computation 

### Impact  
- Licensed technology 
- Nex company formation 
- Improved crops 
- Next-generation scientist 

## II- Back to farm: What you need to understand on farming
### Photosynthesis
### Agricultural history
### Genomics and phenomics
### Photosynthesis 
### Drought tolerance 
### Nutrient uptake 
### Microbial interactions 
### Response to pathogens 

## III- From Python Basic to advanced Deep Learning algorithms 

### First steps in Python
- Learn to use Python for common tasks: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/
- Computer vision
    - https://www.pyimagesearch.com/
    - https://eu.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-computer-vision--ud810
- Good practices: https://docs.python-guide.org/

### Machine Learning and Deep Learning
- Stanford syllabus: http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs20si/syllabus.html
- fastai.com : a really good introduction for coders to Deep Learning
- Siraj Raval Maths of Intelligence: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRJCOz3AfYY&list=PL2-dafEMk2A7mu0bSksCGMJEmeddU_H4D
- Deep Learning, by Ian Goodfellow, more theorical: https://github.com/janishar/mit-deep-learning-book-pdf

### Advanced
