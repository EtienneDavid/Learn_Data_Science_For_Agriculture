# Learn_Data_Science_For_Agriculture

You want to use the power of Data Science for Agriculture ? I've gathered ressources to improve in both domains in order to be able to tackle the biggest issues

## I- The biggest challenges to adress 

A healther, more, sustaniable world achieved through imagination, innovation and collaboration 

### Grand challenges: 
- Increase production of more nutritional food 
- Presere naturalressources like water and topsoil 
- Develop sustainable sources of bioenergy 

### Innovative Technology to accelerate discovery 
- Genomics / Phenomics 
- Crisp genome editing 
- Robotics / Imaging 
- Computation 

### Impact  
- Licensed technology 
- Nex company formation 
- Improved crops 
- Next-generation scientist 

## II- Back to farm: What you need to understand on farming
### Plant Science
- Photosynthesis
- Genomics and phenomics
- Drought tolerance 
- Microbial interactions 
- Response to pathogens 

### Agriculture
- Agricultural history
- Nutrient uptake 
- Soil Management
- Water management

## III- Deep Learning
